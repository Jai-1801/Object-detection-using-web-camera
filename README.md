# Object Detection Using Webcam ðŸ“¸

## AIM
To write a Python code to perform object detection using a webcam.

---
## PROCEDURE

1.  **Load Network:** Load the pre-trained YOLOv4 network (weights and configuration files) using `cv2.dnn.readNet()`.
2.  **Load Class Labels:** Read the class labels from the `coco.names` file, which correspond to the objects the YOLOv4 model can detect.
3.  **Get Output Layers:** Identify the output layers of the YOLO network. These are needed to get the detection results after a forward pass.
4.  **Initialize Webcam:** Start video capture from the default webcam using `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`.
5.  **Process Frames:** For each frame captured from the webcam:
    * Convert the frame into a format suitable for YOLO (a "blob") using `cv2.dnn.blobFromImage()`.
    * Set this blob as the input to the network (`net.setInput()`).
    * Perform a forward pass through the network to get the raw detection data (`net.forward()`).
    * Parse this raw data to extract bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and class IDs for all detected objects.
6.  **Apply Non-Max Suppression (NMS):** Use NMS to filter out weak and overlapping bounding boxes, keeping only the most relevant ones.
7.  **Draw Detections:** For each valid detection, draw a bounding box around the object and label it with the class name and confidence score using `cv2.rectangle()` and `cv2.putText()`.
8.  **Display Output:** Show the processed frame (with detections) in an OpenCV window using `cv2.imshow()`.
9.  **Exit Condition:** Allow the user to quit the application by pressing the 'q' key.
10. **Cleanup:** After the loop finishes (or is exited), release the webcam resource (`cap.release()`) and close all OpenCV display windows (`cv2.destroyAllWindows()`).
